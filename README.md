# üç≠ Description  

The proposed application assists daily diabetes management for children by in collecting information about the patient and calculating the amount of carbohydrates in a meal if it is not known based on the nutrients and the amount in the meal. The importance of accurate carbohydrate counting is that a miscalculation of the insulin dose may cause poor blood sugar control.
The application also takes care of special cases that may need accurate doses and constant reminders to re-examine every certain period. In addition, the application provides sufficient information and educational references necessary to manage the disease daily without the need to refer to the doctor. It also automatically generates logbooks to use as a replacement for the manual logbooks during their periodic doctor visits at the Diabetes Center in KSUMC.
